            The effects of forest degradation, fragmentation, and climate change occur over long time periods, yet
            relatively few data are available to evaluate the long-term effects of these disturbances on tropical
            species occurrence.

            During the last few decades, much attention has focused on how global change is affecting the environment
            and species distributions. Land-use change is still the major cause of species declines worldwide, but
            changes in species distributions have been documented even in pristine and protected areas

            The rapidly developing field of ecoacoustics offers methods that can advance multi-taxa animal surveys at
            policy-relevant extents. While the field is promising, there remain foundational assumptions that need to
            be tested across different biomes before the methods can be applied widely.

            Automated acoustic recorders can collect long-term soundscape data containing species-specific signals in
            remote environments. Ecologists have increasingly used them for studying diverse fauna around the globe.
            Deep learning methods have gained recent attention for automating the process of species identification in
            soundscape recordings.

            In this study, we evaluated deep convolutional neural networks for classifying the calls of 24 birds and
            amphibian species detected in ambient field recordings from the tropical mountains of Puerto Rico.
            Training data were collected using a template-based detection algorithm followed by a manual validation
            process.
