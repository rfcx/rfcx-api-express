        <h2 class="work-title work-info__title">Prevent Illegal Deforestation</h2>
        <p class="work-descr work-info__descr">
          Illegal deforestation is a gateway activity to clearing rainforest, one of the primary causes of climate change.
          According to the UN up to 90% of logging in tropical rainforests is illegal.
        </p>
        <p class="work-descr work-info__descr">
          The reason we start with a focus on stopping illegal logging is because, in case after case, we have seen first
          hand that if you can protect the trees, you end up protecting everything else.
        </p>
        <p class="work-descr work-info__descr">
          The RFCx monitoring system gives our partners the opportunity to protect key rainforest areas and respond to
          real-time alerts, while sharing large amounts of ecosystem data that help negotiate increased protections in these areas.
          In some cases, protecting the perimeter of a rainforest can actually mean protecting everything behind it.

        <p class="work-descr work-info__descr">
          Our goal at Rainforest Connection is to make sure poachers no longer have free reign over the world’s rainforests.
          To that end, we use the RFCx system to help our partners recognize patterns of activity related to poaching,
          including alerts for trucks, cars and motorcycles being used by poachers in key protected areas.

        <ul class="work-descr work-info__descr">
          <li>
            In Africa we were able to demonstrate on a test basis that protecting and monitoring one key road used
            by poachers could enable the protection of a large area of rainforest.
          </li>
          <li>
            We were able to show patterns of activity related to vehicles and poaching in the protected area after dark and during the weekends.
          </li>
          <li>
            The RFCx system helped our partners allocate limited manpower to to target key times and days each month where
            poaching activities were statistically very high.

              For the first time in history we’re within a stone’s throw of creating the world’s most remarkable data set:
              A trove of life science and eco-data on a platform that lets scientists compare month over month, year over

              In Ecuador we initiated our first proof of concept by monitoring two endangered species of parrots that our partners
              re-introduced to a key reserve area. Sound/Alerts and patterns of activity help rangers to monitor, support and protect
              the successful re-introduction of the species.

            <li>
              24/7 alerts for the vocalizations of these endangered species have provided local ecologists a trove of data to study
              and improve outcomes for the reintroduction of key species.
