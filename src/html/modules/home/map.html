      We can use technology and big data to enable on-the-ground partners to save the world’s most threatened
      rainforests and habitats. Saving rainforests isn’t only the key to halting climate change, It’s also vital
      to supporting many of the world’s poorest communities who rely on rainforests for food, shelter and livelihood.
